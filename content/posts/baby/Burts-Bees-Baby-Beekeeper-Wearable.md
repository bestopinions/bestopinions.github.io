# Review of Burt's Bees Baby Beekeeper Wearable Blanket

As a social media influencer, I'm always on the lookout for products that are not only functional but also stylish. That's why I was excited to try out the Burt's Bees Baby Beekeeper Wearable Blanket.

## Design

First off, I have to say that the design of this blanket is adorable. It comes in several different patterns, all of which are gender-neutral and perfect for both boys and girls. The fabric is soft and breathable, made from 100% organic cotton, and the quality is top-notch.

## Functionality

But the real test of any baby product is how well it functions, and I'm happy to report that the Beekeeper Wearable Blanket does not disappoint. The zipper is easy to use and opens from the bottom, making diaper changes a breeze. The armholes are also a great feature, allowing your baby to move their arms freely while still keeping them warm and cozy.

## Safety

One of the things I love about this blanket is the peace of mind it gives me as a parent. It's designed to be a safe sleep solution, with no loose blankets or excess fabric that could pose a suffocation risk. Plus, the wearable design means that it stays in place, so there's no worry about it slipping off during the night.

## Conclusion

All in all, I highly recommend the Burt's Bees Baby Beekeeper Wearable Blanket. It's stylish, functional, and safe, making it the perfect addition to any baby's sleep routine.
