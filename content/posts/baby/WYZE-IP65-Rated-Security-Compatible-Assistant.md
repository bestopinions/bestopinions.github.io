# Review: Wyze Cam Outdoor

Are you looking for a security camera that is both affordable and reliable? Look no further than the Wyze Cam Outdoor!

## Overview

The Wyze Cam Outdoor is a wireless security camera that is designed to withstand the elements. It is IP65 rated, meaning it is dust-tight and can withstand low-pressure water jets from any direction. This makes it ideal for outdoor use, even in harsh weather conditions.

## Features

The Wyze Cam Outdoor comes with a variety of features that make it stand out from its competitors. It has a 1080p Full HD video quality, which provides clear and crisp images. It also has night vision, which allows you to see in the dark up to 25 feet away. This is especially helpful for monitoring your property at night.

The camera also has a 110-degree field of view, which is wider than most other security cameras on the market. This means you can monitor a larger area with just one camera. Additionally, it has two-way audio, which allows you to communicate with anyone near the camera.

## Smart Home Integration

The Wyze Cam Outdoor is compatible with both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. This means you can control the camera with your voice, as well as integrate it with other smart home devices. For example, you can set up routines that turn on your porch light when the camera detects motion.

## Easy to Install

One of the best things about the Wyze Cam Outdoor is how easy it is to install. You don't need any professional installation or wiring, as the camera is completely wireless. All you need to do is mount the camera where you want it, and connect it to your home Wi-Fi network using the Wyze app.

## Pricing

Perhaps the best thing about the Wyze Cam Outdoor is its affordability. At just $49.99, it is significantly cheaper than most other outdoor security cameras on the market. This makes it a great option for those on a budget who still want to keep their home secure.

## Conclusion

Overall, the Wyze Cam Outdoor is an excellent choice for anyone looking for an affordable and reliable outdoor security camera. With its impressive features, smart home integration, and easy installation, it is a great option for homeowners who want to keep their property safe without breaking the bank. I highly recommend it!
