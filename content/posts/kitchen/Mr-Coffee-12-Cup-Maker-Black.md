# Review: Mr. Coffee 12-Cup Coffee Maker

If you're a coffee lover, you know that having a good coffee maker is essential for starting your day on the right foot. I recently had the chance to try out the Mr. Coffee 12-Cup Coffee Maker, and I have to say, I was impressed.

## Design and Features

The first thing that caught my eye about this coffee maker was its sleek black design. It looks great on my kitchen counter, and it's a nice change from the usual stainless steel coffee makers I've had in the past. The 12-cup capacity is perfect for me, as I often have friends over to share a cup of coffee or two.

One of my favorite features of this coffee maker is the delay brew option, which allows you to set a timer for when you want your coffee to start brewing. This is perfect for those early mornings when I want to have a fresh cup of coffee waiting for me when I wake up.

## Performance

The Mr. Coffee 12-Cup Coffee Maker didn't disappoint when it came to performance. It brews coffee quickly and efficiently, and the coffee tastes great. The brewing process is also relatively quiet, which is a plus for me since I'm usually the first one up in my house.

The coffee maker is also easy to clean, which is always a plus in my book. The removable filter basket and glass carafe are both dishwasher safe, making cleanup a breeze.

## Final Thoughts

Overall, I would definitely recommend the Mr. Coffee 12-Cup Coffee Maker to anyone in the market for a new coffee maker. It's stylish, efficient, and easy to use, and it makes a great cup of coffee. Plus, with a price point of under $30, it's an affordable option that won't break the bank.
