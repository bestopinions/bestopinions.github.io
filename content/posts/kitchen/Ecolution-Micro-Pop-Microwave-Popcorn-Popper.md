# Review: Ecolution Micro-Pop Microwave Popcorn Popper

If you're a popcorn lover like me, you know that microwave popcorn bags can be convenient but also wasteful and unhealthy. The Ecolution Micro-Pop Microwave Popcorn Popper offers a solution to this problem, allowing you to make your own popcorn at home quickly and easily.

## Design and Build

The first thing I noticed about the Ecolution Micro-Pop is its sleek design. It's made of heat-resistant borosilicate glass with a silicone lid and base. The popper is also dishwasher safe, making clean up a breeze. The popper can hold up to 3 quarts of popped popcorn, perfect for sharing with friends and family.

## Using the Popper

Using the Ecolution Micro-Pop is simple. Just measure out your desired amount of popcorn kernels, add them to the popper, and microwave for a few minutes until the popping slows down. You can add any toppings you like, from butter and salt to more creative flavors like cinnamon sugar or Parmesan cheese.

## Results

I was pleasantly surprised by how well the Ecolution Micro-Pop worked. The popcorn came out fluffy and evenly popped without any burnt kernels. Plus, I felt good knowing that I was using a product that was more environmentally friendly than traditional microwave popcorn bags.

## Conclusion

Overall, I highly recommend the Ecolution Micro-Pop Microwave Popcorn Popper for anyone who loves popcorn and wants a healthier, more sustainable option. It's easy to use, easy to clean, and produces delicious popcorn every time. Plus, it's a great way to save money on expensive microwave popcorn bags in the long run.
