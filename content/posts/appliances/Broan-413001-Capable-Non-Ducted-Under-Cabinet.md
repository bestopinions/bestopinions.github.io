# Review: Broan 413001 Range Hood

As someone who loves to cook, I know how important it is to have a good range hood in the kitchen. That's why I decided to test out the Broan 413001 range hood. Here's what I found:

## Design

The Broan 413001 range hood is designed for under-cabinet use, which means it sits neatly beneath your cabinets and doesn't take up too much space. It has a sleek, modern design that would fit in with any kitchen decor.

## Performance

The Broan 413001 range hood is capable of removing smoke, steam, and cooking odors from your kitchen. It has two fan speeds so you can adjust the ventilation to your needs. I found that it worked really well, even when I was cooking something particularly smelly like fish.

## Installation

Installation was fairly easy, although I did need someone to help me hold it in place while I screwed it into the bottom of my cabinets. It comes with a non-ducted filter, which means you don't need to install a vent to the outside. This is great if you're renting or don't want to do major renovations in your kitchen.

## Maintenance

The non-ducted filter is easy to remove and clean, and the range hood itself is easy to wipe down with a damp cloth. I appreciate that it doesn't require any special cleaning products or tools.

## Price

At around $50, the Broan 413001 range hood is a great value. It performs well, looks good, and is easy to install and maintain.

## Conclusion

Overall, I'm really happy with the Broan 413001 range hood. It's a great choice for anyone who wants a good range hood that doesn't require major installation or maintenance. I would definitely recommend it to anyone in the market for a range hood.
