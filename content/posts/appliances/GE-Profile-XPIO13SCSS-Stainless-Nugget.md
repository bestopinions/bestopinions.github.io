# Review: GE Profile XPIO13SCSS Stainless Steel Nugget Ice Maker

As a social media influencer, I'm always on the lookout for the latest and greatest products to share with my followers. Recently, I had the opportunity to try out the GE Profile XPIO13SCSS Stainless Steel Nugget Ice Maker, and I have to say, I was thoroughly impressed.

First off, let me just say that I'm a huge fan of nugget ice. There's something about those small, chewable pellets that just make any drink better. So, needless to say, I was excited to try out this ice maker.

One of the first things I noticed about the GE Profile XPIO13SCSS is how sleek and modern it looks. The stainless steel exterior is not only attractive, but it's also durable and easy to clean. And, at only 15 inches wide, it's the perfect size for most kitchens.

Setting up the ice maker was a breeze, and I was able to start making ice within minutes of unboxing it. The machine can produce up to 80 pounds of ice per day, which is more than enough for my household. Plus, it has a built-in water dispenser, so you don't have to worry about filling it up manually.

But, let's get to the important part - the ice. The GE Profile XPIO13SCSS produces some of the best nugget ice I've ever tasted. It's soft and chewy, but also melts quickly in your mouth. I've used it in everything from water to cocktails, and it's always a hit.

Overall, I would highly recommend the GE Profile XPIO13SCSS Stainless Steel Nugget Ice Maker to anyone who loves nugget ice as much as I do. It's easy to use, produces high-quality ice, and looks great in any kitchen.
