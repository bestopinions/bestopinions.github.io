I especially love the white noise option, which helps drown out any outside noise and creates a peaceful environment for my baby.

The rechargeable battery lasts for a long time, and it's convenient to be able to take the sound machine with me when we travel. The timer feature is also helpful, as I can set it to turn off after my baby falls asleep, so it doesn't run all night.
