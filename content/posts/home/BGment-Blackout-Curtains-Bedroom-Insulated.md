# BGment Blackout Curtains Review

As someone who loves a good night's sleep, I was excited to try out the BGment Blackout Curtains. These curtains promise to block out 100% of sunlight and UV rays, as well as reduce outside noise and insulate against heat and cold. I was curious to see if they would live up to these claims.

## Installation

Installing the curtains was a breeze. They come with grommets already attached, so all I had to do was slide them onto my curtain rod. The instructions were clear and easy to follow, and I had the curtains up in no time.

## Design

The curtains have a sleek, modern design that would fit in with any decor. I chose the grey color, which is a nice neutral that goes well with my bedroom. The fabric is soft and feels high-quality, and the grommets are sturdy and well-made.

## Performance

The real test, of course, was how well the curtains actually blocked out light and sound. I was pleasantly surprised to find that they did indeed live up to their claims. When I closed the curtains, my room was pitch black, even in the middle of the day. I also noticed that the curtains helped to muffle outside noise, making it easier for me to sleep through the night. I didn't notice much of a difference in temperature, but I imagine that will be more noticeable in the winter.

## Final Thoughts

Overall, I'm really impressed with the BGment Blackout Curtains. They look great, were easy to install, and most importantly, they actually work. If you're someone who struggles with getting a good night's sleep due to light or noise, I would definitely recommend giving these curtains a try. They're affordable, effective, and stylish â€“ what more could you ask for?
