As a social media influencer, I am always on the lookout for the latest and greatest products that can make life easier for parents. That's why I was excited to try out the Hatch Rest Night Light, a night light that promises to help parents get better sleep and soothe their little ones at night. In this review, I will share my experience with the Hatch Rest Night Light and whether I think it's worth the investment.

My first impression of the Hatch Rest Night Light was that it was sleek and stylish. The design is modern and would fit in with any decor. The device itself is small and compact, making it easy to move around the house. The night light has a few different features, including a sound machine, a night light, and a time-to-rise feature. I was excited to try out all of these features to see how they worked.

## Features

### Sound Machine

The sound machine feature on the Hatch Rest Night Light is one of my favorite features. It has a variety of different sounds to choose from, including white noise, rain, and lullabies. The sound quality is excellent and can be adjusted to the perfect volume. I found that the sound machine helped soothe my little one to sleep and drowned out any background noise.

The Hatch Rest Night Light also functions as a night light, which is perfect for parents who need to check on their little ones at night. The night light has a variety of different colors to choose from, including red, blue, and green. The colors can be adjusted to the perfect brightness, depending on your preference.

### Time-to-Rise Feature

The time-to-rise feature on the Hatch Rest Night Light is perfect for parents who are trying to establish a sleep routine with their little ones. The device has a clock that can be set to a specific time, and when that time arrives, the device will change from a night light to a wake-up light. The wake-up light slowly brightens to help little ones wake up naturally and without any fuss.

The sound machine is excellent, and the night light is perfect for parents who need to check on their little ones at night.
