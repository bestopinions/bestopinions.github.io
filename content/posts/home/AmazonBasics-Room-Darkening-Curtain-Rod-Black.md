# AmazonBasics Room Darkening Curtain Rod - Review

When it comes to decorating your home, the details can really make a difference. One of those details is your curtain rods. You might not think much about them, but the right curtain rod can really tie a room together. That's why I was excited to try out the AmazonBasics Room Darkening Curtain Rod.

## Features

First, let's talk about the features of this curtain rod. It's made of sturdy steel, which means it can hold up to 22 pounds. That's enough for most curtains, even heavy blackout curtains. The rod comes in three adjustable sizes: 28-48 inches, 48-88 inches, and 88-120 inches. This means you can find the perfect size for your windows.

The AmazonBasics Room Darkening Curtain Rod also has a few features that make it stand out. First, it has a wrap-around design that helps keep light out. This is especially useful if you're using blackout curtains. Second, it has a smooth, easy-to-slide design. This means you can open and close your curtains with ease.

## Installation

Installing the AmazonBasics Room Darkening Curtain Rod was a breeze. The instructions were clear and easy to follow. All you need is a drill and a few basic tools. I had the rod up in just a few minutes.

## Performance

I've been using the AmazonBasics Room Darkening Curtain Rod for a few weeks now, and I'm really happy with it. The wrap-around design does a great job of keeping light out. I've noticed a big difference in how dark my bedroom is in the morning. The smooth, easy-to-slide design also makes it easy to open and close my curtains.

## Value

The AmazonBasics Room Darkening Curtain Rod is priced competitively. It's not the cheapest curtain rod on the market, but it's also not the most expensive. I think it's a fair price for the quality and features you get.

## Conclusion

Overall, I'm really happy with the AmazonBasics Room Darkening Curtain Rod. It's a high-quality, sturdy curtain rod with some great features. If you're looking for a curtain rod that can hold up to heavy curtains and keep light out, this is a great option.
