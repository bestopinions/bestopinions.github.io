# Product Review: Yankee Candle Large Lilac Blossoms

As a social media influencer, I'm always on the lookout for products that are worth sharing with my followers. And when it comes to candles, Yankee Candle is a brand that needs no introduction. Recently, I had the opportunity to try out their Large Lilac Blossoms candle, and I have to say, I was impressed.

## Packaging and Design

The first thing that caught my eye was the beautiful packaging. The candle comes in a classic Yankee Candle jar with a simple yet elegant label. The lilac color of the label perfectly matches the fragrance of the candle, which is a nice touch. The jar itself is sturdy and well-made, which is important for a candle that will last for a long time.

## Fragrance

Now, let's talk about the fragrance. Lilac Blossoms is a classic floral scent that is perfect for spring and summer. The fragrance is light and fresh, not overpowering at all. It's the kind of scent that will make you feel like you're walking through a garden full of blooming lilacs. The fragrance is long-lasting and will fill your room with a beautiful scent for hours.

## Burn Time

The Large Lilac Blossoms candle has an impressive burn time of up to 150 hours. That's over six days of continuous burning! This makes it a great value for money, as you'll be able to enjoy the fragrance for a long time.

## Conclusion

Overall, I would highly recommend the Yankee Candle Large Lilac Blossoms candle. The packaging is beautiful, the fragrance is lovely, and the burn time is impressive. It's the perfect choice for anyone who loves floral scents, especially in the spring and summer months. If you're looking for a high-quality candle that will last for a long time, this is definitely one to consider.
