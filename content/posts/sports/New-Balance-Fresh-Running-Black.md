# Review: New Balance Fresh Foam 1080v11 Running Shoes

As a social media influencer and avid runner, I am always on the lookout for high-quality running shoes that will help me perform at my best. Recently, I had the opportunity to try out the New Balance Fresh Foam 1080v11 Running Shoes, and I have to say, I was thoroughly impressed.

## Comfort and Fit

One of the first things I noticed about these shoes was how comfortable they were. The Fresh Foam midsole really lives up to its name, providing a cushioned, plush feel that makes each stride feel effortless. The shoes also have a generous amount of room in the toe box, which is great for those with wider feet or who prefer a more relaxed fit.

I did find, however, that the shoes run slightly large, so I would recommend sizing down a half size if you prefer a snugger fit. Additionally, the shoe has a high heel-to-toe drop, so it may take some time to get used to if you are used to running in more minimalist shoes.

## Performance

In terms of performance, the Fresh Foam 1080v11s really shine. The outsole provides excellent traction on both wet and dry surfaces, and the shoes are lightweight enough to allow for a quick pace without sacrificing support.

I also appreciate the shoe's breathable upper, which allows for plenty of airflow to keep my feet cool and dry even on longer runs. I have yet to experience any blistering or discomfort while wearing these shoes, even during my longest runs.

## Style

Finally, I have to mention the shoe's sleek design. The black colorway with subtle white accents is not only stylish, but also versatile enough to pair with a variety of running outfits. The shoes also come in a range of other color options to suit your personal style.

## Conclusion

Overall, I highly recommend the New Balance Fresh Foam 1080v11 Running Shoes to any runner looking for a comfortable, supportive, and stylish shoe. While they may take some time to get used to if you are not used to a high heel-to-toe drop, the shoes' performance and comfort make them well worth the investment.
