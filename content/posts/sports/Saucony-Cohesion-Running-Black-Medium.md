# Review: Saucony Cohesion Running Shoes

As a running enthusiast and social media influencer, I am always on the lookout for the latest and greatest gear to enhance my performance. Recently, I had the opportunity to try out the Saucony Cohesion Running Shoes in Black/Medium and I must say, I was thoroughly impressed.

## Comfort

One of the first things I noticed about these shoes was how comfortable they were. The cushioning was just right, providing enough support for my feet without feeling too bulky. I also appreciated the breathable mesh upper which allowed my feet to stay cool and dry during my runs.

## Fit

The Saucony Cohesion Running Shoes fit true to size, which is always a plus when ordering shoes online. They also have a traditional lace-up closure, allowing for a customizable fit. I found that the shoes hugged my feet nicely without feeling too tight or constricting.

## Durability

After several runs in these shoes, I can attest to their durability. The outsole provided great traction on a variety of surfaces and showed minimal signs of wear and tear. The upper also held up well, showing no signs of stretching or tearing.

## Style

While style may not be the most important factor when it comes to running shoes, it certainly doesn't hurt to have a pair that looks good. The black and medium colorway of the Saucony Cohesion Running Shoes is sleek and modern, making them a versatile option that can be worn with a variety of workout outfits.

## Overall Impression

Overall, I highly recommend the Saucony Cohesion Running Shoes to anyone in the market for a comfortable, durable, and stylish pair of running shoes. They provide excellent support and cushioning, while also being lightweight and breathable. Whether you're a seasoned runner or just starting out, these shoes are definitely worth considering.
