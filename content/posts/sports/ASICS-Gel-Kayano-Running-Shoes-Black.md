# ASICS Gel-Kayano Running Shoes: A Review

If you're a runner, then you know that having the right pair of shoes can make all the difference in your performance. That's why I was excited to try out the ASICS Gel-Kayano Running Shoes. Here's what I thought:

## Comfort

Right out of the box, these shoes felt comfortable. The gel cushioning in the heel and forefoot provided a nice amount of cushioning without feeling too squishy. The upper mesh material was breathable and didn't cause any rubbing or irritation.

## Support

The Gel-Kayano shoes are designed to provide a high level of support for runners. The Dynamic DuoMax Support System helps to reduce overpronation (when your foot rolls inward too much while running) and the Trusstic System reduces weight while maintaining structural integrity. I definitely felt that my feet were well-supported while wearing these shoes.

## Fit

I ordered my usual size and found that the shoes fit true to size. The toe box was roomy enough without feeling too loose, and the heel didn't slip at all while running. I appreciated that the laces were easy to adjust for a custom fit.

## Style

While style isn't the most important factor when it comes to running shoes, it's still nice to have a pair that looks good. The Gel-Kayano shoes come in a variety of colors, and I thought the black and silver pair I tried looked sleek and stylish.

## Overall Impressions

Overall, I was impressed with the ASICS Gel-Kayano Running Shoes. They were comfortable, supportive, and looked good. While they're a bit on the pricey side, I think they're worth the investment for serious runners who want a high-quality pair of shoes.
