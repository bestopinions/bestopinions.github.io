# New Balance Running Thunder X-Wide: A Review

As a social media influencer and avid runner, I’m always on the lookout for the best running shoes on the market. Recently, I had the chance to try out the New Balance Running Thunder X-Wide shoes, and I have to say, I was impressed.

## Comfort

One of the first things I noticed about these shoes was how comfortable they are. The X-Wide design provides plenty of room for my feet, and the cushioning in the soles feels great, especially on longer runs. I also appreciate the breathable upper, which keeps my feet cool and dry even on hot days.

## Support

The Running Thunder X-Wide shoes also provide excellent support. The midsole is designed to absorb shock and reduce impact, which is especially important for runners who are prone to joint pain. The shoes also have a sturdy heel counter and a reinforced toe box, which helps to prevent injuries.

## Traction

Another standout feature of these shoes is the traction. The outsole is made from durable rubber and has a multidirectional tread pattern, which provides excellent grip on a variety of surfaces. I’ve worn these shoes on everything from pavement to dirt trails, and they’ve held up well in all conditions.

## Style

Finally, I have to mention the style of these shoes. While performance is obviously the most important factor for running shoes, it doesn’t hurt to have a pair that looks good too. The Running Thunder X-Wide shoes come in a variety of colors, so there’s something for everyone.

## Overall Impressions

Overall, I would definitely recommend the New Balance Running Thunder X-Wide shoes to other runners. They provide excellent comfort, support, traction, and style, all at a reasonable price point. Whether you’re a serious runner or just looking for a comfortable and reliable pair of shoes for your daily walks, these shoes are definitely worth checking out.
