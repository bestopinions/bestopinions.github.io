# Review: Under Armour Charged Pursuit Running Shoes

As a social media influencer, I am always on the lookout for the latest and greatest products to share with my followers. Recently, I had the chance to test out the Under Armour Charged Pursuit Running Shoes, and I have to say, I was really impressed.

## Comfort

First and foremost, these shoes are incredibly comfortable. The Charged CushioningÂ® midsole provides just the right amount of support and cushioning, so my feet never felt tired or sore, even after a long run.

## Design

The design of the shoe is also worth noting. I loved the sleek, modern look, and the mesh upper provided excellent breathability. The rubber outsole also gave me great traction, even on wet or slippery surfaces.

## Durability

I've been running in these shoes for a few weeks now, and they still look and perform like new. The materials seem to be high-quality and durable, so I expect these shoes to last me for many more runs to come.

## Price

At a price point of around $70, these shoes are definitely on the more affordable end of the spectrum when it comes to running shoes. That being said, they still offer great quality and performance, so they're definitely worth the investment.

## Final Verdict

Overall, I would highly recommend the Under Armour Charged Pursuit Running Shoes to any fellow runners out there. They offer a perfect balance of comfort, design, durability, and affordability, making them a great choice for anyone looking for a reliable pair of running shoes.
