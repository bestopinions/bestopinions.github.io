When it comes to performance, the Brooks Ghost 14 shoes did not disappoint. They have a lot of cushioning, which makes them great for absorbing impact and reducing fatigue. The shoes also have good traction, so I felt confident running on a variety of surfaces. One thing I noticed is that the shoes felt a bit heavy at first, but I quickly got used to the weight.

## Durability

I've only been using the Brooks Ghost 14 shoes for a few weeks, but so far they seem very durable. The materials feel high-quality and well-made, and I haven't noticed any signs of wear and tear yet.
