One of the most notable features of the Adidas Ultraboost Running Shoes is the Boost technology in the midsole. It provides exceptional cushioning and energy return, making your runs more comfortable and efficient. The shoes also have a Torsion Spring that provides added support for your feet and helps you maintain a smooth stride.
