The first thing I noticed when I put on these shoes was how comfortable they are. The cushioning on the sole is just right, providing enough support without feeling too bulky. The upper part of the shoe is made of a lightweight mesh material that allows for breathability during long runs. The shoes fit true to size and there is no need to break them in.

When it comes to performance, these shoes do not disappoint. The Charged CushioningÂ® midsole delivers a responsive ride, giving you the energy return you need to power through your runs. The outsole is made of solid rubber, providing excellent traction on different surfaces. 

## Price

The Under Armour Charged Assert 8 Running Shoes are priced at $69.99, which is a great value for the quality and performance they provide.
